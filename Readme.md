# Brendan Krull's ME 759 Final Project for the Fall 2017 Semester

##### Please Note: The dataset used was too large to upload to github. The datasets can be found at this link here:

#These files cannot be read by my project in their current state! I have included a python file called fileConverter.py, which should convert the files properly. 
### Also included is the same thing in a .ipynb file, if you prefer that. 

##### Alternatively, I am hosting a .zip file of the text files here on my dropbox:
